Built using Gatsby.

## Contributions

The tutorials certainly need contributions. Note that the tutorial pages are written in React and JSX. So to edit parts of the source code you would need info about JSX and React.

The project structure : **src** folder houses a **pages** folder and **components** folder.

The components folder houses files that are used for rendering singular components on pages such as the header, the footer, the basic layout etc.

The pages folder contains the JS Files written in React and JSX for tutorial pages that are later rendered to HTML Pages.

Just make any changes or add any pages with the predefined layout and start a pull request to the repo.
